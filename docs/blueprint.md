## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant indigo, hex value #6366F1, chosen to represent intelligence and professionalism on a dark theme. (HSL: 238, 92%, 67%).
- Background color: A deep, desaturated indigo-grey, hex value #161722, providing a clean and non-distracting canvas. (HSL: 238, 15%, 11%).
- Accent color: A striking cyan, hex value #06B6D4, used for highlighting interactive elements and complementing the primary indigo. (HSL: 191, 91%, 43%).
- Semantic colors: Emerald (#10B981) for success/optimization, fiery red (#EF4444) for bugs/critical issues, and vivid orange (#F59E0B) for security warnings.
- Headings: 'Poppins' (sans-serif), bold (weight 600-700), for a modern and approachable feel.
- Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif), readable weights (400-500), for clear and clean communication.
- Code snippets: 'JetBrains Mono' (monospace), for excellent readability in code environments.
- Clean, minimalist vector icons with a subtle glow for AI-related elements; generally geometric and consistent with a 'GitHub x Linear x Notion' aesthetic.
- Top navigation bar (70px height) with logo, central navigation, and right-aligned utilities (profile, theme toggle, upgrade). Main content area features a 60/40 split-grid for code input and AI feedback, with secondary screens like history using a fixed sidebar.
- Subtle micro-interactions including AI typing animations, soft glowing borders during analysis, gentle green pulses for success states, and smooth slide-in panels for explanations.
